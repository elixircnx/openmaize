## New library (Phauxth) and status of Openmaize

First of all, I plan to continue maintaining Openmaize as long as people
are still using it, but I have also started work on a library called
[Phauxth](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth), which is designed
with Phoenix 1.3 in mind and is also a lot more extensible.

If you are using Phoenix 1.3, take a look at Phauxth.

## Openmaize

Authentication library for Plug-based applications in Elixir

Openmaize is a collection of functions, built on top of Plug, which
can be used to authenticate users.

It should work with any application that uses Plug, but it has only been
tested with the Phoenix Web Framework.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/riverrun/openmaize/wiki) for more
information about Openmaize.
