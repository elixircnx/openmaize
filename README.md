Authentication library for Plug-based applications in Elixir

Openmaize is a collection of functions, built on top of Plug, which
can be used to authenticate users.

It should work with any application that uses Plug, but it has only been
tested with the Phoenix Web Framework.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/riverrun/openmaize/wiki) for more
information about Openmaize.
